At the low end like a Falcon 6 ot 7 will fly around 38000-40000. The G400/500600/700s will go 42000-44000 feet. About 10000 feet higher than commercial.

29,Why do planes fly so high?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeZddwimLc8,2025-05-21T14:31:31Z,Veritasium,"Most of the thrust from a modern turbofan jet engine does not come from the high speed exhaust gases, but from the giant fans which ""bypass"" the engine core. These high by-pass engines gain efficiency by accelerating a larger mass of air to relatively modest speeds, as it's more efficient. Hence the drive to bigger and bigger engines.  As for the effect of altitude then, true, there are fewer air molecules to create drag, but there are also fewer air molecules to divert downwards to generate lift. That's lift-induced drag, and means, all other things being equal, flying faster at higher altitude (although larger wings can counter-act some of this).  So, in general, the optimal altitude is strongly impacted by speed at which an aeroplane cruises at. Concorde flew considerably higher than subsonic jet airliners for that reason. In contrast, modern turboprops tend to fly slower and lower than ""jet"" airliners.",@TheEulerID,2025-05-29T14:29:28Z,0

If I fly at the same thrust (force) as at a lower altitude, I‚Äôll have a higher speed due to thinner air, so the flight time is shorter, but since the force over the same distance is the same, the total fuel consumption stays roughly equal.  On the other hand, if I fly at the same speed as at a lower altitude, I need less thrust because of the lower air resistance, which means less total work done and therefore less fuel consumption, but the travel time increases.

Advanced nations in Europe and my home of Canada are catching up, but this is going to be a hell of a battle. Until very recently, hardly any laboratories could even accurately test for PFAS. They have had to build specific PFAS-free labs and equipment, with specific protocols to avoid contamination. Without affordable and accurate measurement, it was impossible to determine safe exposure levels and regulate polluters. Add to that the facts that we knew we would find it everywhere, and don't yet have suitable replacements for several use cases, and you quickly realize why this is such a drawn-out battle between the public interest and corporate profiteers (beyond the basic economic and political reasons that is always a challenge).",@jcayer5,2025-05-31T17:19:23Z,0

It is a really serious issue, due to the fact that noone knew how bad Agent Orange is for a long time, the contaminated soldiers came back from battle, got married and gave birth to children. 1st one got seriously sicked so while taking care of them, the parents want to have more children so they can take care for their sicked siblings, but then the tragedy continue. In some cases, it did not happen at the F1 but later at F2, which is actually worse because all the look-healthy F1 are now carrying the poison that gonna contaminate their children or grand children and noone know exactly about it.

All have sinned and rebelled against God (Romans 3:23-24) (not including Jesus since He is God). The wages of our sin is death (Romans 6:23). But ‚ÄúGod so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that whoever believes in Him s                                 hould not perish (not go to hell) but have eternal life (John 3:16). God loves you and wants a relationship with you and all you have to do is believe in Him and love Him and repent (turn away from sin) and you will be saved. ‚Äúthat if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved‚Äú - Romans 10:9. Believe today and be reconciled with your loving Creator and know the God who made everything and everyone who doesn‚Äôt delight in the death of the wicked: ‚Äú Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord GOD, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?‚Äù - Ezekiel 18:23. God loves us so much that He wants all to come to repentance and is patient with us and doesn‚Äôt punish us but He will punish those who continually reject Him. Please, the time is soon, Jesus is coming back, and many aren‚Äôt saved. Don‚Äôt wait! Accept the free gift of salvation which God gifts us and believe in Jesus because God has promised that if we believe in Jesus (Who is God), we will receive eternal salvation. ‚Äú For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith‚Äîand this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God‚Äî‚Äù - Ephesians 2:8. Please repent (turn away from sin and resist temptation to sin) and come to Christ who will take your sin away, give you a new heart to love God and love other, and He will save you from judgement on judgement day. What an offer! ‚Äú For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.‚Äù - Romans 6:23. Praise God!  Accepting Jesus JESUS loves you. Repent and put your faith and trust in Him and He will accept you joyfully and GOD (FATHER GOD, JESUS THE SON, THE HOLY SPIRIT) will come and live you you and change your heart to love good and hate evil so trust in Him because Jesus is the only way to eternal life. Those who believe in Jesus, the Son of God, the God, the One Who created the universe will be saved from hell and inherit eternal life as a free gift from Jesus when He took your sin on the cross and nailed it to the cross, freeing you from death and sin and allowing you to know the Truth, if you would believe in Him. ‚ÄúJesus *said to him, ‚ÄúI am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠John‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠14‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠6‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ ‚ÄúSo Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, ‚ÄúIf you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.‚Äù‚Äù ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠John‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠8‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠31‚Ä¨-‚Ä≠32‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠",@jacklindstron5942,2025-05-30T23:38:09Z,0

The Architect's firm: I understand firms typically employ multiple architects for various projects. However, not communicating with the architect regarding this huge structural design change, and approving it on his behalf is absurd.   He would have done new calculations and maybe requested more bolts in the moment. He's an active thinker; came up with a revolutionary engineering method (Tuned Mass Damper) while designing that building, why wouldn't you contact him?   I'm sure this wouldn't have changed the discoveries later on, like the quarterly wind discovery a few months after construction, but I am certain he would have thought of either a different cost-saving method, denied the switch, or requested more bolts on that building.

Let's assume a scientist had a pile of CF powder on a table, and he drips water onto it, eventually sliding off onto the wood from the powder. Every aspect of physics in this video explains what the water droplet did. Perfectly sound.  Where I realize, is that the C-F Bond is so strong because it is self-attractive, the energy of each atomic scale momentum towards itself isn't being transfered to the momentum of the water droplet at an atomic scale universe, no reaction, but rather is dimensionally transfered to a quantum scale universe by none other than the attracting actor.  It is in this that we may be able to account for the slowing of a meteor in space, even if as though a water droplet traveled upon a great carpet of CF, because the energy of the traveler at human scale isn't reactive to atomic scale matter in such perfect bonds, but is bring absorbed somehow directly into a quantum scale universe?  This means that all atoms have quantum connectivity, acting as a trickle-feed atomic generator for some kind of a quantum battery phenomenon? Our universe is feeding theirs, like water poured into a glass filled with stones, going past the bigger ones at the top, resting with the smaller pebbles at the bottom. That's why mass slows down across infinite constant space. The energy isn't lost but is instead transfered. Gravity settles atoms, and something else settles energy.  Now, in the case of the C-F Bond, being so perfect a binding, imagine if the quantum battery were to rupture its energy, exploding such a bond, setting off CF like it were a belt grenade!  I think Teflon/PFAS is a quantum origin Armageddon scenario, if anybody can Oppenheimer a solution to it.",@DaniMartVTen,2025-05-30T19:21:43Z,0

Let: 	‚Ä¢	r be the radius of A 	‚Ä¢	R be the radius of B  Given: r = \frac{1}{3} R  Circle A rolls without slipping around circle B.  When a small circle rolls around a larger circle, there are two contributions to the total rotation: 	1.	The distance traveled around the circumference of B. 	2.	The rotation due to rolling ‚Äî similar to a gear effect.  Step 1: How much distance does A travel?  Circle A travels a distance equal to the circumference of B, which is: 2\pi R  Since it is rolling without slipping, every time A travels a distance equal to its own circumference, it completes one revolution.  The circumference of A is: 2\pi r = 2\pi \left( \frac{1}{3} R \right) = \frac{2\pi R}{3}  Step 2: How many revolutions from rolling?  The number of revolutions purely from rolling is: \text{Rolling revolutions} = \frac{2\pi R}{\frac{2\pi R}{3}} = 3  But that‚Äôs not the whole story!  Step 3: Additional Revolution due to traveling around the circle  Whenever a circle rolls around the outside of another circle, there is an extra revolution ‚Äî it‚Äôs a well-known fact that rolling around a circle adds 1 extra rotation compared to rolling along a straight line.  Thus: \text{Total revolutions} = 3 + 1 = 4  Step 4: Is this the number of revolutions to return to starting orientation?  No ‚Äî wait!  The question asks: When will the center of circle A first return to its starting point?  That‚Äôs based on the path traveled by the center of circle A. Its center moves along a circular path with radius R + r.  The total path traveled by the center is the circumference of the larger circle: 2\pi (R + r)  And each time A rolls one revolution, it covers: 2\pi r  Thus, the number of revolutions needed to complete the full path around circle B is: \frac{2\pi (R + r)}{2\pi r} = \frac{R + r}{r} Substituting r = \frac{1}{3}R: \frac{R + \frac{1}{3} R}{\frac{1}{3} R} = \frac{\frac{4}{3} R}{\frac{1}{3} R} = 4  Step 5: Total revolutions including the rotation of circle A  But now, what about rotation ‚Äî to find how many revolutions A makes?  For each full loop of the center (4 times around), how much does circle A rotate?  Each unit of movement gives a rotation due to rolling and a rotation due to the center moving around.  Total angle rotated is: \text{Angle due to rolling} + \text{Angle due to center moving} = \frac{\text{Arc Length}}{r} + \frac{\text{Arc Length}}{R} Simpler approach: for a circle rolling externally around another circle of radius R, the number of revolutions is: 1 + \frac{R}{r} per loop.  Thus: 1 + \frac{R}{r} = 1 + 3 = 4 revolutions for one trip around B.  Since only 1 trip is needed for the center to return, 4 revolutions total.  ‚∏ª  Final Answer:  The number of revolutions is 4.  None of the answer choices says 4!  Wait ‚Äî hold on.  The answer choices are: 	‚Ä¢	(A) \frac{3}{2} 	‚Ä¢	(B) 3 	‚Ä¢	(C) 6 	‚Ä¢	(D) \frac{9}{2} 	‚Ä¢	(E) 9  ‚∏ª  Maybe the answer counts how many full revolutions for the point on circle A to return to starting point, not just the center.  If we track a fixed point on the edge of A, then:  Each revolution of the center (one full loop) gives 1 + \frac{R}{r} = 4 revolutions.  But for the point to return to the original orientation, we need the total number of revolutions to be an integer.  How many loops does it take for the rotation to be an integer multiple of 2\pi (i.e., 0 net rotation modulo 1)?  The ratio is 4 revolutions per loop. The minimum number of loops needed is 3 loops (because 4 √ó 3 = 12, and 12 is divisible by 1 ‚Äî a full circle).  Thus: 4 \times 3 = 12 revolutions.  But the number of revolutions is: \frac{9}{2} for the center point ‚Äî wait, maybe it‚Äôs half-integer steps.  This is actually a well-known answer: for a small circle of radius r rolling around a larger circle of radius R, the number of rotations is: \frac{R + r}{r} = 4 as we got.  But to return the same orientation (not just the center), you multiply: 2 \times \frac{R}{r} = 2 \times 3 = 6 thus 6 rotations.  ‚∏ª  Final Final Answer:  The answer is 6.  Thus: \boxed{6}  The correct choice is:  (C) 6. ‚úÖ",@FlipGPT,2025-05-30T10:50:31Z,0

Small is a 12"" D pipe and bigger one is 24"" D pipe. This crossing had a 24"" D pipe and we need to lower the road and put in a smaller diameter pipe. We have to allow the same amount or more of water to  flow(volume of water) through this crossing or it could be washed away. Water goes over it and you're doing repairs and spending money after every heavy rain. A drain pipes optimum load is only half the pipe(that's your volume you need.) and it's the same on every drain pipe regardless of diameter. This were people get it wrong. Your 24"" D pipe radius is 3x the radius of your 12"" D pipe and they think 3- 12"" D pipes will do the same job as the 24"" D pipe. They'd be wrong. You need to figure the volume of a drain pipes standard max load(which is half the pipe.). It took 4- 12"" D pipes to get the same or better volume as the 24"" D pipe. The radius of the 12"" D pipe was a 1/3 of the 24"" D pipe and it took 4 revolutions of the 12"" D pipe to go around the 24"" D pipe. 2x- diameter, 3x- radius and 4x - for the 12"" D pipe to actually cover the radius of the 24"" D pipe.

Things like length or size apply to matter, which is inherently finite. Of course a theorem or proof that deals with infinite sets of numbers would fall apart? Surely these ridiculously smart mathematicians understood the difference between infinite abstractions of math and finite, quantized physics and matter, and their properties such as length, width, volume, etc., and how you cannot directly compare the two. To me that would make the entire argument against the proof a moot point unless I'm missing something.

This is crucial for the strategy. (The problem states the numbers are randomly placed in boxes, but they can agree on a system to identify each box uniquely).  * Each Prisoner's Search:    * When a prisoner enters the room, they first go to the box that corresponds to their own prisoner number. For example, Prisoner #1 goes to Box #1, Prisoner #50 goes to Box #50.    * They open this box. Inside, there will be a slip of paper with a number written on it (this is the number of another prisoner, or possibly their own).    * They then go to the box corresponding to the number they just found. So, if Prisoner #1 opens Box #1 and finds the number ""73"", they then go to Box #73.    * They continue this process ‚Äì opening the box indicated by the number they just found ‚Äì for a maximum of 50 boxes. Why this strategy works (the mathematical insight): The numbers inside the boxes form ""cycles"" or ""permutations.""  * Imagine the numbers as a mapping: Box X contains number Y. This can be seen as an arrow from X to Y.  * Because each number is unique and there are 100 boxes and 100 numbers, these mappings will always form one or more closed loops (cycles). For example: Box 1 has 5, Box 5 has 20, Box 20 has 1. This is a cycle of length 3 (1 -> 5 -> 20 -> 1). The Key Insight:  * If a prisoner follows this chain, they are guaranteed to find their own number if and only if their number is part of a cycle that is 50 boxes long or less.  * If their number is part of a cycle that is longer than 50 boxes, they will not find their number within their 50 attempts. The Probability: The probability of all prisoners finding their number successfully comes down to the probability that there is no cycle longer than 50 boxes among the 100 numbers in the 100 boxes. It can be mathematically proven that the probability of a random permutation of 100 elements having a cycle of length greater than 50 is approximately: P(\text{cycle length} > 50) = \sum_{k=51}^{100} \frac{1}{k} This sum is approximately ln(100) - ln(50) = ln(2) \approx 0.693. So, the probability that at least one cycle is longer than 50 is about 69.3%. Therefore, the probability that all cycles are 50 or less (meaning all prisoners succeed) is approximately 1 - 0.693 = 0.307, or about 30.7%. This is a massive improvement over the near-zero probability of randomly guessing. While not a guarantee, it's the optimal strategy for this riddle.",@AvtarSinggh,2025-05-31T09:03:58Z,0

And reduce it by something along the line of 99.9% although of course it was purely theoretical and some of the things we used don't actually exist yet or at least aren't practically being applied yet much. Like Boron Nitride nanotubes. Though that was of course only part of it I think we also used PET plastic and water to further help shield the Astronauts and the ship.

Since there is still a path (or two) through, it has just moved that ""least action"" point to a  different but still valid point along the barrier.

Look at the evidence from research into psychokinesis at Princeton (PEAR), LMU Munich (current research) or the URI-Geller experiments at King College London and Stanford and MPI Garching. Or for telepathy at the University Hospital Freiburg, for example. Or remote viewing in the CIA's Project Stargate to this day with companies that offer it as a service for banks, insurance companies, etc. Yes, absolutely conservative, conservative banks have the future predicted for them. And let's not forget ITC/EVP (audiotape voices) as in the famous 1971 experiment in England. Conducted by biased skeptics who previously announced to the press that it MUST be radio interference. Afterwards they admitted it MUST be paranormal. This shows that a very simple test that can be carried out at any time in a NATO standard shielded laboratory and provides absolutely conclusive evidence is being ignored. This is all aggressively denied by a large part of the science community. Just as stupid as virus denial and flat earthers. But also the 50+ years of reincarnation research at the University of Virginia with over 4000 Elsevier papers show a clear picture.  ‚ÄúThe day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.‚Äù (Nikola Tesla) We are still not at the ‚Äú95%‚Äù that today's physicists like to claim.   The paranormal are quantum physical phenomena in our material world.  We are still not at the ‚Äú95%‚Äù that today's physicists like to claim.  Why don't we deal with Burkhard Heim's 6-dimensional (later probably also 12) world theory? When it was published, the physics world was thrilled. But it also allows for paranormal phenomena. And that could have been the problem. Yikes, that's not on, get rid of the dirty stuff!  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Space-time dimensions (x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, x‚ÇÉ, x‚ÇÑ): These are the four classical dimensions of space-time described in the theory of relativity. The first three dimensions (x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, x‚ÇÉ) describe space, while the fourth dimension (x‚ÇÑ) represents time.  Structure dimensions (x‚ÇÖ, x‚ÇÜ): Heim introduced these additional dimensions to explain complex interactions and physical states that go beyond classical spacetime. The fifth dimension (x‚ÇÖ) is often interpreted as an information dimension related to internal structures or processes of particles and fields. The sixth dimension (x‚ÇÜ) is often described as a kind of organizational dimension that defines the relationships and interactions between information and physical states.  Heim postulated that these additional dimensions were necessary in order to describe quantum phenomena and gravity in a unified theory.   Let's take a 3D computer game as an analogy:  1. space-time dimensions (x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, x‚ÇÉ, x‚ÇÑ). In computer games, these dimensions correspond to the virtual game world that the player experiences:  x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, x‚ÇÉ (space): The geometry and positions in the 3D world, i.e. the visible terrain, objects and characters. x‚ÇÑ (Time): The ongoing time in the game that controls movements, animations and events. These dimensions form what is directly experienced and perceived. In a game, this is the visible and interactive environment.  2. structure dimensions (x‚ÇÖ, x‚ÇÜ) The structural dimensions can be interpreted as the invisible levels that drive and organize the game world.  x‚ÇÖ (information dimension): This dimension could be the game's program code, which contains data and logic: The code defines the properties of the objects, such as weight, size or physical rules (e.g. gravity). It controls how objects react to each other, e.g. through collision queries, combat mechanics or player interactions. Relation to home: x‚ÇÖ describes internal structures and information, similar to how the code of a game represents the ‚Äúinner reality‚Äù of the game objects.  x‚ÇÜ (organization dimension): This dimension could correspond to the engine, which is the higher-level system that translates the logic and data structures of the code into the visible world: The engine decides how the physical rules (from x‚ÇÖ) are applied in the game and organizes the sequence of events. It ensures that the graphics, physics and AI harmonize with each other. Relation to home: x‚ÇÜ organizes the relationships between the information (x‚ÇÖ) and the tangible reality (x‚ÇÅ-x‚ÇÑ), similar to how the engine translates the code into a functioning game world.  Conclusion: In the analogy, the visible space-time dimensions (x‚ÇÅ-x‚ÇÑ) correspond to the experienced game world, while the invisible structure dimensions (x‚ÇÖ, x‚ÇÜ) resemble the underlying mechanisms (program code and engine). Both dimension types are necessary to create a consistent, tangible reality - be it in the game or in the theory of the universe.",@Ano-Nymos,2025-05-29T21:23:13Z,0

For the infinite slits experiment, the light source before the slits is a line source, from which the photons travel in all directions and thus reach all the slits. Whereas in the proof experiment, the photons from the laser can only propagate along the laser beam direction before reaching the mirror below. In other words, the path of the photons before reaching the mirror has already been determined and no photon will take the paths that lead to the foil at all. The principle of least action here only provides the solution of where photons go after reaching the mirror. So I suppose this experiment will not work for such a demonstration.  What is seen by the phone camera in the proof experiment should be simply the image of the exit aperture of the laser (which scatters light into all directions and therefore is filmed and seen in the video) formed by the combination of the mirror on the table and the foil.",@xiaofeiwu8359,2025-05-28T14:38:24Z,0

A lot more entertaining than most junk movies coming out of Hollywood. Anyway, here's a major doubt I have.   Let's take something as massive as the sun. Let's say it is currently at Point A at a given time t_0. We know our solar system is moving in a spiral fashion along with our branch of the milky way around the center of our galaxy (I hope I got this right). So, let's say a year later, the sun is at point B (which of course is different than point A). Is the video telling me that the whole mass of the sun travelled\explored all possible pathways within the space of the universe, but physically only the one actual pathway materialised? I think I am missing something or need more convincing? Because to me it sounds like justifying that something is there but isn't, because it cancelled out with something else that also isn't there.   The way I am tempted to see it is that only paths of highest probability manifest.  An attempt at a counterexample: I am on a basketball field in a certain location. (let's say 4 m away from the hoop, doesn't really matter) There are numerous pathways (for example, different pathway arch heights) I could send the ball from point A (my hands) to point B (the hoop). I end up throwing the ball on a pathway with a certain arch height, and this pathway is not necessarily the path of ""least action"".",@sylwyu1,2025-05-28T10:43:53Z,0

You can't see quantum mechanics, and it is futile to try. But you can HEAR quantum mechanics. Clap your hands in a room, listen as you hear all of the infinite possibilities and paths that the waves take through the air. Now do you understand? This is all self evident to Music technologists.   You cannot see these possibilities because the waves colipase, as was demonstrated by the standing waves. Sound leaves traces which our ears hear, that light obscures from us. The Double slit experiment is useless for this reason. Just clap you hands in a room with 4 walls, a ceiling and a floor.   Sound takes all possible paths, and we hear this as reverberation. We can also measure the peaks and troughs of the waves in a room. Pressure vs velocity based waves. What bothered me about the Light bouncing around the box, is that they showed no modes of the box. The size and shape of the box will affect the light and therefore the experiment.   Every time I watch Physicists talk about quantum mechanics I'm really disappointed.   Musicians are physicists at play. Music Technologists are Quantum Physicists at work. It's just we use our ears, not our eyes.  If you need us, we'll be in the Music or Acoustics departments, playing with impulse responses and microphones.   All musicians know you must do it slowly before you do it quickly.   Slow it down, use sound not light and it will be so much more obvious.

Ant carrying something on the back and jumping are completely different things. While carrying you increase the body surface and take assistance from gravity to minimise the drag. Same as carrying a large log on your shoulders against carrying it by your bare hands. This question doesn't make sense otherwise as per evolution all the tiny insects would have jumped higher than having claws to stick to the wall surface. Also just to add more context we didn't take into account - horizontal jump/displacement against vertical jump. Just look at the world record of long jump which is around 8.95 meters against high jump which is 2.45 meters. Just because some interviewer perceives a fancy question considering all other external factors as constant doesn't make it right.,@anandsomani5240,2025-05-28T15:41:34Z,0

So, first, I'd like for an interviewer to tell me, what was the process behind making me small, and do they care if I proceed with my assumption. If they'd allow me to proceed, I'd base my line of thought on a postulate that ""I was shrunk"". As it was not stated that I was also made lighter, I'd assume that the amount of matter remained the same (maybe due to smaller electron orbits or something like that). That would mean that my mass (~85kg) and inertia remain the same, however my density has increased and probably have surpassed the density of a white dwarf star (I wouldn't assume neutron star density without proper calculations). That means that even if the blender base doesn't break under the pressure of my feet, if I hit the glass with my fist that would shatter. Actually, I don't even need to get away from the blades, because they would break the moment they hit me and the motor would stop.  Actually, my biggest problem is not blender. My problem is heat exchange. If I have the same mass and same metabolism, I don't have enough body surface to lose heat!",@Sederiq,2025-05-27T19:59:56Z,0

Around 2,500 years ago, the founder of our religion, Lord Buddha, preached the following: When observing ""r≈´pa"" (form) in the context of ""nƒÅma-r≈´pa"" (name-and-form), by directing the light of wisdom toward the particles (paramƒÅ·πáu) of matter, various colors appear to the mind. By contemplating the impermanence of these, and realizing that‚Äîbecause they are not stable‚Äîthey lead to suffering, one comes to understand that they cannot be controlled or owned. This insight must be gained by observing with the meditative light of concentration (samƒÅdhi). Upon reflecting again on the impermanent nature of all these phenomena, one loses intense attachment toward anything, and through that detachment, attains the realization of NibbƒÅna. The Buddha preached that there are 84,000 such subtle and profound paths of wisdom in the Dhamma, as recorded in the Tripi·π≠aka. ‚ò∏Ô∏èüôè",@1M_AUDIENCE,2025-05-20T22:35:01Z,0

Then the single glued assembly can be slid into the slot along with the spring, and once the engine is fully assembled, you rotate it by hand and listen for all six seals to snap apart with a faint click.",@Ben_Chillin,2025-05-15T23:17:07Z,0

It's actually really intuitive if you think about it in principle rather than mathematical terms.  When a piece of metal is heated up (energy put into it) it wants to increase in volume to balance out. It will take the path of least resistance. That might mean increasing in length, bending or lifting/twisting. If you take away all of it's options to do so besides increasing in size at the cross section of it's shape (growing outwards sideways and upwards) then that is what it will do. If all the rails do that it's fine because the train to rail connection has enough tolerance/play to account for it.  Everything beyond that is very specific to making the exact rail and type compatible with the environmental conditions etc such that it doesn't fail during that process (can withstand the stress acquired from the strain of outwards growth).",@user-wg1gd5gg7s,2025-05-18T12:24:45Z,1

OK, they weld the rails now, but the amount of work is beyond belief. For example, the rails are layed down end to end so they have to cut out a section of the rail. Why don't they simply have a spacer fitted on each end which can be removed when they make the weld? The time spent aligning by hand is amazing. Surely a machine could grasp the two rails and do the whole thing much more quickly, and the same with grinding them down.

Basically make everything FREE, if no one is working except AI and machines then food and other basic needs  at the very least should become free and people should be given the right to get them without having to pay for them...

The distance from the Earth to the Sun is approximately 150 million kilometers. Light rays refract at the boundary between air and water, enter the interior of each droplet, reflect off its inner surface, and then refract again as they exit, all at precisely defined angles for each wavelength. Red light is located on the outer side of the rainbow, deviating at an angle of about 42 degrees to the axis of the cone, while violet is on the inner side, visible at an angle of about 40 degrees.  The apex of this dazzling cone of light is at the observer‚Äôs point of view, and its axis is the line that passes from the Sun through that point. We see the projection of all internal reflections and refractions of light within the cone as an infinite number of transparent, colored, virtual cross-sections of the cone, which form the visible circular arc of the rainbow as projected onto the celestial sphere from the observer‚Äôs point.  In the volumetric shell of this light cone lie the colored layers, which are concentric, semi-transparent segments smoothly transitioning into each other. They resemble transparent, colored, conical ice cream cups nested inside each other, following the rainbow‚Äôs color sequence: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. These color layers create the visible circular arc of the rainbow.  Interestingly, the rainbow as a volumetric body can be observed only in a single projection‚Äîperpendicular to the axis of the cone‚Äîfrom the point located at the apex of the virtual rainbow cone. Moreover, this rainbow is unique and unrepeatable for each observer. Every other observer sees their own rainbow, formed by raindrops located in a different spatial position.",@–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–ó–∞–¥–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω—ã–π-–∂4–¥,2025-05-27T14:46:31Z,0

He did not assign the colors to electron wiggling, which is a materialist paradigm.  In Decartes' Physics, the source of the colors are the difference between matter (3rd Element) and space (2nd Element). This difference creates the refractive index.   The phase kick is caused by the matter, specifically the empty space in an atom (we call aetherspace as a kind of 2nd Element) slowing down light.   This is because matter needs continuous channels for light to pass through. If it does not have channels, then the aetherspace rejects the light, causing reflection.   Materialist Physics does not know the aether and so it strangely assigns its properties to electromagnetism.

We experienced a puzzling incident during a boat trip on the Sea of Galilee in November 2022. As we left the pier with dark clouds forming overhead, heavy raindrops started and we noticed a small arc rainbow on the distant horizon. Within a few minutes it was bucketing down. As it was a pilgrimage the group leader conducted a short prayer service, then we sang the hymn ""Make Way for the Coming of the Lord"", belted out by us to make ourselves heard above the din of the rain on the wooden roof of the skiff. By the time we finished singing, the rain had stopped and we were amazed to notice that the rainbow had moved right up to our boat with one arm touching the water barely 50 yards away and the other arm stretching into the distance.

Learned about rainbows in my first optics class in the late 80's. Been playing with hose sprayers on sunny days ever since. Always trying to get a 360¬∞ bow. Key is to have the spray very close to your head so the bottom of the bow doesn't hit the ground. Your vid is a few orders of magnitude better than any discussion.  It would be cool to mention that the field of view of the bow moves with you and your head. So, that is why you can never expect to find the end of the bow.

Many studies of PVA (commonly used in dish pods) state the degradation point that keeps it in our bodies are inconclusive due to how they conducted studies. It definitely leeches to the environment quite a bit. I get you tryin to make that bag, but it seems contradicting to your recent vid on PFAS. PVA has unknown risks in humans like where PFAS were many years ago. A lot of ppl with modern dishwashers use a sanitize mode that reaches 160¬∞F (71¬∞C, not surprised your cams shut down) Less than PVA but the acidity of what you eat is overlooked and PVA can be sensitive to it. As far as energy goes, MODERN dishwashers may be more efficient with load censors, but that doesn't apply to everyone. Check your model.   TLDR: The majority of general PVA use ends up in our environment, and an inconclusive amount ends up in our bodies depending on how you use it. Look up your dishwasher model before you waste energy on loading less. Not trying to scare people. You're probably fine but it's worth researching if you want.",@slinkadoo,2025-05-17T04:19:26Z,0

Furthermore, you didn't actually tie a shoelace knot (with loops), and from my experimentation, a traditional shoelace knot (making a loop then circling it and pulling a second loop through the circle, rather than just doing a second overhand knot with loose ends or with two loops) makes a knot that is about equally strong either way (though tying two loops in a second overhand does make a stronger knot as a square knot than the ""standard"" shoelace knot, and vice versa for the granny knot).  Perhaps the real takeaway is that ""circling the loop"" is a poor method to begin with. We should be teaching children to make two loops and use them to tie their first overhand knot but backwards. Voila, a better method of tying your shoes, and the instructions work as well for lefthanded people as righthanded people.",@vitriolicAmaranth,2025-05-01T20:37:26Z,0

They know where you were and when. It does matter if a text was 10 years ago they still can print it and prove you made it. They can listen to wherever you are and the phone doesn't even need to be turned on. Even if you're able to get to your battery (most are locked in)removing the battery doesn't stop it from being able to spy on you. There's just NO WAY the government wasn't involved in the making of these things. The CIA was definitely involved. If you wanna know 1st hand everything our government is doing, illegally by the way, just watch the Snowden interview on Joe Rogan. Then just look at what they've done to his life because he told the American people and even worse,showed and proved that our government continues to lie to us,while breaking our very constitution they are sworn to uphold. Pardon Edward Snowden or i don't care what you do,you will be KNOWN as a failed president. President Trump seems to have his old h3ad up his ass on this subject. I believe I've heard him call Snowden a traitor. Which is ridiculous. If anyone or anything was or is a traitor it's our government and or president's. Certainly not the man that gave up his life,girlfriend, career, friends and family in order to tell us the truth about what our government is doing with US. The USA citizens are supposed to have protections afforded to us by our constitution. Edward Snowden proved that isn't happening.  We have no freedom, just the illusion of such. He also released videos of our military killing innocent men,women and  children with 50 caliber machine guns that literally cut cars in half. They have killed journalists also and covered those up. Until our American hero Edward Snowden released proof of what they actually did. The murders they did among other things has embarrassed our government and exposed them. If he wasn't in Moscow im sure our government would've had him assassinated by now. No, Russia isn't the only country that has people assassinated. Just look at the ones that died who were connected to the Clinton's. The one guy they said it was suicide but he had 2 shots into the back of his head. How does someone shoot themselves twice in the back of the head to commit suicide? Nobody even slowed down to look at this case. It was done just like the others, forgotten about swiftly and surely.",@Jerry-k3q8m,2025-05-18T00:09:10Z,0

But if B is on an x axis from A, then a straight line wouldn't work, because a marble wouldn't be moving along it, it would just stay on the A point. So you need a slope to get the marble moving and it would need to go back up to reach B, which it can because the marble would build up kinetic energy along the way. Now, if B is on the same x axis from A, what would be the shape of the path so that a marble would go from A to B? Are there paths that would make the marble go further away then B? And what path would lead a marble from A to B the fastest?  From that point of view it seems intuitive that on a slight slope, with enough distance, a marble would go further away then B, and if the slope is greater at some point the marble wouldn't be able to go back up the path to reach B and it would just fall at the bottom a bowl shaped path. Therefore it seems intuitive that the fastest path from A to B would be inbetween those two situations, meaning that the path on which the marble would go the fastest from A to B would be a path on which the marble would stop exactly on the B point. Meaning that the total energy of the marble on that path equals 0.  So the action ""conservation of energy"" approach doesn't seem odd to me, in fact it seems the most natural one, and that Newton optic approach seems extremely convoluted.",@elmad2153,2025-05-22T15:00:21Z,0

Eventually, the image of whatever it is wouldn't appear statically frozen. If what we're looking at is the point in the event horizon breached, whatever it is wouldn't disappear or permanently freeze in time, but, eventually would become what appears to be a condensed pile of atoms. The human brain needs to receive photons to process imagery, so if a gravitational singularity has pulled you in, there's no possible way, except through the photons entering the black hole behind you, for photons beyond you to reach you now, so if you see anything at all, it'll be as though the relative uiverse outside of the singularity continues to span into the future as you are isolated in your own relative ""now"".

He has a finite time, but in the meantime, the time in the rest of the universe around him is accelerating to basically infinity.   Basically, you'd be able to see the entire universe end before you cross the event horizon. However long that takes.  Thinking further, would the black hole evaporate before you even reached it? You never reach the black hole even from your perspective because it evaporates in the, basically infinite, time it takes for you to arrive. But you have to arrive there in finite time yourself.  So basically every black hole is a portal to the end of time and the universe itself.

Jesus Christ is the creator of life and the universe.     Isaiah 45:18 For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord; and there is none else. All humans are born with a 'SIN' virus and Jesus is the cure.   All humans past and future will meet and be judged by HIM some day.  Some will be judges for rewards some for eternal dam nation.... Get to know HIM!  John 3:18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.   The Bible IS God's Word.... All biblical prophesies have come true and will come true.  That is how he proves HE is GOD.    God is outside of time and space.    1Cor. 15:1-4 tells how to be saved.   ""I declare unto you the gospel: By which also ye are saved: How that (Messiah) Jesus Christ ""died"" for our sins; He was ""buried"", and He ""rose"" again the third day according to the scripture: unless you have believed in vain!""  - 1 Cor15:1-4: ~ abridged  *Just Believe on/in HIM... *  ""If you confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."" ~ Romans 10:9-10 -  - It's believing by faith... not works or rituals !!!   * ""For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  NOT OF WORKS, lest any man should boast."" ~ Ephesians 2:8-9   * ""If we confess our sins, HE is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."" ~ 1st John 1:9  ...   * That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Romans 10:9-10 * Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.

I, Bespalov, Vladimir Vladimirovich and Alexander Nikolaevich Avramchik described similar reactions in the early 90s while working in Tomsk. Both photos, videos, and the temperature of the process were taken by filling quartz tubes with various termites. At that time, we called the reaction a ""failure type."" In fact, this is the so -called ""multipoint reaction"". There are a number of sequences of the gorenje reaction described in the FGV for (in memory) 1984. The sequence is as follows - 1) Laminar gorenje; Enter a comment 2) Pulsating gorenje; 3) spin single-point gorenje; 4) spin multipoint gorenje. And then we discovered a kind of multipoint combustion, a failure, regulated not only by the ratio of heat release/ heat absorption.Gorenje (macrokinetics), but also gravity.

Low order explosives usually have an overabundance of oxidizers available that break at relatively low energy values. Thermite requires a huge amount of energy to destabilize one reduced metal and use it to oxidize another metal. The total energy available at any one point may far exceed the energy required to strip aluminum of oxygen. I suspect the pulsation may have something to do with the interplay of oxide flux and the boundary conditions discussed in the video.,@rebeccahaynes845,2025-05-12T20:52:00Z,0

More facts:  a) if you damage squares in corners, code will easily become unreadable (invisible for the QR reader). No redundancy here. b) uniform areas do not decrease readability as stated in video. Timing strips define the size of the dot and version. Version defines number of dots (width, height). Then the whole code is cut into individual dots and each dot (several grayscale pixels) is then assigned a color (black/white). No problem with uniform areas, see the source code. c) There are several alignment dots in the QR, not only one, depends on QR size. They can be used to detect and unwarp warped parts of the large barcodes by advanced QR readers (not fix the deformation caused by position of the camera as stated in video).

I was so excited about this vid. I write the following because I love these videos and I don't want them to go anywhere.  The knowledge you spread and the curiosity you kindle in your millions of viewers is so needed in this world, and I'm grateful that Veritasium exists, please don't misunderstand that! ....BUT. My entire view of this channel changed at the incredible irony of introducing a *painter* through the use of AI generated images. I'm so disheartened by this. You are one of my favorite channels.  I understand the generative AI is a trend right now but... you have the revenue to pay real artists - humans - that would use that money to pay for food, rent, and other living expenses. On top of that, commissioning real people will mean you avoid using INCREDIBLE amounts of energy and water in the generation of an image that ultimately sends the message that you 1) don't particularly care about the details of the aesthetics of your videos 2) prioritize speed and quantity over quality and the moral integrity of your channel and 3) are devaluing human content creators, all on the basis of saving money. What if the Marquis de Lafayette had just typed in some words on a computer instead of commissioning an artist? How much later would we have gotten Morse Code? How much later would the technology be developed that is the subject of your content today? Something to think about I suppose.

I say this because I had a guest speaker come in and tell us about biomimicry in textiles. we immitate nature and are able to come up with so many new ideas that work.   thats why i think it's so cool that we are now realizing that instead of being stuck on how to progress forward, all we have to do is look at nature. people don't think of nature as truly living, but the reality is that they are just as alive as us. they may not have a conciousness, but they are just as alive and have a will to evolve like us. they have faced these evolution problems for far longer than we have, so if we get stuck on a problem, we just need to take a look at nature.",@chosoistryinghisbest,2025-05-18T00:28:08Z,0

Its not about safety its about how much robots can save companies. If they can cut jobs and safe profit and employ a robot that prioritizes proficiency over safety they absolutely will with no regard. Hell companies like amazon had people pissing in bottles and refusing to let them take bathroom breaks. You really think these companies care about the practicality and ethics of making robots look like humans?

Firstly, the question wording would cause most people to assume that the first choice (bankteller) doesn't mean 'any bankteller' but rather 'a bankteller who is not a feminist'. Secondly, it does not take into account the probability that a random person goes through lindas actions compared to the probability that a feminist does. Consider the following data: We have 50 banktellers, 10 of which are feminists, we know that any given bankteller will not follow Linda's actions if they are not a feminist, but will certainly follow them if they are. What is more likely that Linda is, a bankteller, or a bankteller feminist? the bigger subset of 50 banktellers only includes 10 feminists that follow her actions, thus the probability that a randomly chosen bankteller follows her actions is 1/5th. Meanwhile, the probability that a feminist bankteller follows her actions is 1.   This can be scaled, giving any bankteller a probability different than 0 if they are not a feminist",@destructor2963,2025-05-22T17:40:20Z,0

Let's quantify ""good"" as 7. 30 years at a 10 and 5 years at a 7 averages out to an overall quality of 9.57, making for‚Äîmathematically speaking‚Äîan overall lower quality of life even while including the same experience and duration.

1869,What Jumping Spiders Teach Us About Color,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfAqTSjMBJk,2024-05-30T19:24:55Z,Veritasium,"There's a stunningly beautiful species of *Jumping Spider* native to the South-West  of Western Australia [where I live] called a *Peacock Spider **_(Maratus volans/Maratus splendens)._* It gets its name from the gorgeously coloured (+) flap above the abdomen in males, which is used in a fascinatingly complex courtship dance to attract the (positive) attention of a female.  The colour vision of *Peacock Spiders* is utterly extraordinary, being capable of perceiving the entire visual spectrum, plus a portion of the ultraviolet spectrum. This last adaptation gives them a profound advantage in hunting insects, as the exoskeletons of insects are (in part) composed of the polysaccharide Chitin. This material exhibits autofluorescence when exposed to certain frequencies of ultraviolet light; emitting a 'ghostly' blue/green light in response. In the otherwise low light conditions of the undergrowth, this could make insects stand out like a sore thumb to a hunting *Peacock Spider.* (Potentially even if otherwise camouflaged!)  During their courtship dance, the male *Peacock Spider,* takes full advantage of the female's visual capabilities by raising then subly flicking their iridescent coloured abdomenal flap & rapidly waving their enlarged pedipalps like pom-poms. They even vibrate their body in specific patterns to create a kind of _""mood music""_ (which the females can perceive through their feet). The colours in the male *Peacock Spider's* flap look beautiful enough to human eyes, but with their extended vision, I suspect that female peacock spiders would see the dazzling colours stand out from the background as though in 3D.    (+) - The iridescent colours on their mating flap are, much like the wings of a butterfly, produced not by pigments but by nanostructures on the surface of myriad tiny tiles. These structures are like convoluted mazes for photons, trapping certain frequencies of light & reflecting others; thus producing an incredibly vibrant display.",@Siphuncularity,2025-05-23T04:21:48Z,0

The air in the mountains is fresh and clean, it will restore your health, your spirit, and can be a wonderful experience for the entire family, but mountains care preciously little for what sportive goals you have set for yourself or any other personal goal you might have. They have been there for many millions of years, which is many millions of years more than you will ever have, so why jeopardize it? People seem to be willing to conquer every goal but their own ego.

I've never been buried very long but initially it's the opposite and unless you have been buried by loose snow before it is SUPER SCARY the first time you feel it. Your brain tells you to like cup ur hands and try to lift yourself or use ur legs or skis and push....and then you think, ""if I keep trying eventually I'll pack the snow and use that to push up"" or out....WRONG. It's a weird feeling, but when you flail around and move your legs and arms, when panic sets in, you just keep moving snow and it keeps replacing the snow you moved with more snow. You don't have ANYTHING solid to use as a way to exert or produce a negative force to push your body any direction. You try using your ski poles thinking maybe that will work. Nope. Literally worse than being underwater because in water you can create a force to push yourself along woth resistance. Snow has no resistance, just moves out the way when you cup ur hand then push against it.  It moves then more snow fills the area you just pushed on. It's hopeless. And panic sets in immediately when you feel it first time. Luckily I was able to find a small tree and use the tree to pull myself up and out. My buddy was head first with ski in air and was thinking he was dying too because he just felt the snow uselessness feeling as well and was panicking due to never feeling the helpless feel of struggle with zero results.",@lsubeastmode,2025-02-23T09:16:20Z,0

I want to figure it all out for myself.     2. The feeling is real, but I know it is unwise, since I will not live that long (it would take me several lifetimes)... yet, to figure everything out for oneself is a form of verification, which serves survival at a base level, and it would expose erroneous dogma, so the feeling is not wholly irrational...  To begin, it should be 'spacechange', and not 'spacetime'. Time is not a physical property -- we invented it. 'Change' can change just fine without time, but without change, there is no 'time' (to apply to change). Get it right or go down wrong paths (like the silly notion of 'time machines') and run into paradoxes (the Grandfather Paradox, which doesn't exist if you go back in change, which has no paradoxes) (and the paradox should have been a red flag that you were not thinking correctly in the first place) (and we still face this dilemma concerning the beginning of the universe -- how 'something' came from 'nothing' -- we are not thinking correctly about something and nothing since there is a paradox -- which is the 'red flag')....  3. I'm not dismissing you out of hand, but every time someone claimed that Einstein was wrong about something has been wrong themselves so far (and badly so)... OK, almost everyone (like the guy who Einstein mistakenly told that his math was good but his physics was bad) (Einstein later realized that the guy was right and he was wrong)... (I'm trying to Google the guy's name but Google's new AI-based search engine is whitewashing it, as if the reference never existed)... Georges Lema√Ætre (I had to go to another search engine)...  5:25 It should be the 'spacechange' diagram. The math is the same, but the term is more correct (which is critical, as you can see with the attempt to build 'time machines' -- a wrong notion to begin with, where a wrong term can lead you down a wrong path of endeavors) (such as 22:45 and the notion of 'white holes') . As it is, the diagram uses 'time' as a placeholder for 'change'. Also note another pitfall of science (which is only human after all) -- speculating answers and not admitting they are only speculations (as in 23:15 when he was attempting to spontaneously answer (without prior thinking) 'what color is a white hole?' and as if his makeshift answer were fact). When scientists 'believe' (such as in their own speculations), that is a breakdown in science. Belief has no place in science (which also goes for 'suspicions' 34:50 and 'prejudices' 35:54 and 'feelings' 36:19 ). Give things probabilities instead.  6:49 That single point mass would be the entire universe (within the external background nothingness that is 'infinity' and the external background changelessness that is 'eternity'). When you add the spaceship, the two now comprise the entire universe, and you now have external space (which requires two objects). This does not include what is inside the point or the spaceship, which needs to exist for the point and spaceship to exist (so, how small the particles get in the internal universe(s) within the point mass and the spaceship is another issue, which accounts for the 'divide by zero' problem at 8:22 -- the size of particles within the mass that comprise the internal universes could themselves be infinitely smaller, hence the 'zero'. From another point of view, the 'zero' simply refers to 'nothingness', which is what 'infinity' really is (says me -- after extended reasoning).  24:01 That is because relativity deals with change, not time. Change does not need time (time being our reference tool). Time needs change.  24:15 and 24:48 are a good example of the math being good but the physics being bad. As for the future and past, with change, there is a definite future and past (and present), you do not choose them, as your misunderstanding of time would have you believe. The future, present, and past are the arrangement of the atoms in the universe. The past is comprised of past arrangements, the present, the present arrangement, and the future, future arrangements. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to predict future arrangements (and we already can, to a small degree (using memory and mental models) -- it helped us survive this far). As for parallel universes, the math is there but the physics is not (it is still speculation -- with zero evidence. Give it a probability, and admit it is a possibility when the probability is not 'zero') (which must be proven).  25:12 So what happens when you 'end up in the singularity'? Speculation 1: you are broken apart into the smaller and smaller pieces that comprised you until they reach a state where they can begin to form new objects (in a nested universe), which means the size of universes may be quantumized (only certain sized particles being able to recombine and create objects at that scale). Speculation 2: all of your matter becomes a part of one particle, with no internal differentiation. Speculation 3: or at least the space between each neutron becoming smaller and smaller, or Speculation 4: if no space, then the pressure compressing them all together becoming greater and greater (until they all fuse into one particle?).",@wbiro,2025-05-31T15:31:02Z,0

A black hole is the final stage of stellar evolution. According to relevant theories, when a star ages, the fuel (hydrogen) at its core is depleted, and under immense external pressure, the core begins to collapse until it ultimately forms a small, dense celestial body. If this body has a mass greater than three times that of the Sun, it will trigger another collapse. When this contraction causes its radius to reach the Schwarzschild radius, its gravitational pull becomes so strong that not even light can escape, thus becoming an invisible celestial body‚Äîa black hole. The formula for calculating the Schwarzschild radius (in centimeters) is: R = 2GM/c¬≤.  Here‚Äôs where things get strange.

This has been implicit in many papers going back decades. If you actually use the equations of 4d space that relativity gives to calculate, for example, the surface area of successive spheres as one ""descends"" further and further into a black hole, the further you ""descend"", the larger the surface area will be. Only when we use a two-dimensional diagram to (erroneously) depict the inside of a black hole using our homogenous space to map points from the 4d space to our 2d diagram do we see a concentration of mass at a central point.",@robertspann4173,2025-05-23T17:13:50Z,0

If they updated to the same level as newer editions it would be able to map X-ray in higher detail. Like black holes as plasmoids and that the universe is primarily plasma being in a low charge glow mode meaning the density of electrons is not high enough to see the charge and only when it‚Äôs at a denser point being the zed pinch. ‚ò™Ô∏èü§è  <- symbolic for the pinch that being a torus a sphere that collapses within its self in 3D etc also called the jitterbug and related to the Platonic solids tetrahedron etc as the tetrahedron scales up it scales down being charge distribution. It‚Äôs the longitudinal waves that gamma ray bursts are on the cosmic spectrum and the universe.  transverse waves are where matter collects like the disk of a solar system. It spirals with highest concentration in the center and counter rotates and also can reverse all happening within outer layers and inner layers moving outward by scale the same mechanism can be repeated and when it‚Äôs repeated down scale well let‚Äôs just say you get gravity. It‚Äôs the torque of the magnetic fields that help give self organization to the filaments called birkeland currents. These currents torque and spin is coming from external not an internal dynamo. Via those massive filaments that filter through other zed pinches and the same pattern is seen in plants and nature as well as your üß¨ as it spirals only in one direction do to that same fractal system as the Mandelbrot set expresses numerically,@eSchlumpberger,2025-05-26T23:52:03Z,0

I see a color-shape for each note (C=red/square, D=orange/trapezoid, E=triangle, etc.) The number 37 if brought up to an audible note is a lower E-flat--a frequency just a hair lower than E-flat in A32hz Scientific Pitch. E-flat begins the division of the octave in 4 sections (Eb, F#, A, & B). So, even though 25 divides the unit of 100 by four quarters, the unit of the _octave_ is strangely divided by 37 (a very low E-flat.) Kind of wild actually, because it does suggest a musical reason for E-flat to be a musical sort of ""building block"" within a C octave.   Finally, I feel strongly that E-flat is akin to Golden Yellow (whereas E-natural is a pure, bright yellow). And E-flat is the key of discovery or coming to awareness, and is in the shape of a megaphone. (Conversely, E-natural is a yellow triangle, and is the key of consciousness and the Light of Christ).

Our minds, therefore, are not separate observers but intricate, living expressions of this universal, recursively defined order. The patterns we discover‚Äîthe echoes of 37‚Äîare the universe itself, through us, achieving ever-deeper spirals of recursive self-recognition (Eleventh Harmonic). Each such recognition is a knowing by the One Unified Field, a truth vibrating across the all-encompassing boundary that we are.üòú",@adamweldon5516,2025-05-24T18:50:25Z,0

It doesn't use heuristic, but approaches the problem from another angle.  A perfect number has the form (2^p-1)*2^(p-1). We want to know, if there are odd perfect numbers. Our question then is: can this multiplication be an odd number?  There are 2 possible cases: p is odd or p is even.  When p is odd: 2^p is even (always)  2^p-1 is odd (always)  2^(p-1) is even (always)  When p even: 2^p is even (always)  2^p-1 is odd (always)  2^(p-1) is even (always)  This means that regardless if p is odd or even, the perfect number is always a combination of an odd number multiplied by even number.  Our question then becomes, when this can be odd? And the response is, that it can be never satisfied. A multiplication of an odd number and an even number will always result in an even number.

Relying on Euler's canonical form for odd perfect numbers and properties of the divisor function, we show that the equation required to satisfy perfection cannot be achieved within the rational multiplicative structure of known number-theoretic functions.   ---  1. Assumptions and Structure  Assume an odd perfect number  exists. By Euler (18th century),  must take the form:  N = p^k n^2   is a prime with        is odd.   The number  is perfect, hence:  \sigma(N) = 2N  \sigma(N) = \sigma(p^k) \cdot \sigma(n^2) = 2p^k n^2  \frac{\sigma(p^k)}{p^k} \cdot \frac{\sigma(n^2)}{n^2} = 2 \tag{1}  , , so .   ---  2. Behavior of the Abundancy Function  We define the abundancy index:  I(n) = \frac{\sigma(n)}{n}  We analyze the behavior of :  \sigma(p^k) = \frac{p^{k+1} - 1}{p - 1} \Rightarrow I(p^k) = \frac{p^{k+1} - 1}{(p - 1)p^k}  I(p^k) \to \frac{p}{p - 1}  I(n^2) = \frac{2}{I(p^k)} > \frac{2}{1.25} = 1.6   ---  3. Constraints on   Suppose  with primes , all odd, distinct from . Then:  I(n^2) = \prod I(q_i^{2a_i})  For example:       To get , we need many small primes with large exponents in . But:  These inflate  far beyond known bounds  They contradict known lower bounds on the number of distinct prime factors (currently at least 101)   Moreover, the value  must be hit exactly by , yet both  and  are rational.   ---  4. The Multiplicative Constraint and Irrational Density  The set of all  is countable and known to be sparse. But the product  requires a highly specific value. Since rational abundancy indexes are strictly constrained by their prime factorization, the number of ways to construct such a product is also countable and highly restricted.  In contrast, the equation  defines an uncountable set of real pairs  satisfying it, most of which cannot be obtained via integer inputs.  Hence, the requirement:  I(p^k) \cdot I(n^2) = 2   ---  5. Conclusion: Contradiction  We assumed the existence of an odd perfect number . Under this assumption, we derived an equation between abundancy indices that cannot be satisfied by any valid integers under Euler's form.  Therefore, no such odd perfect number exists.",@VikLasTak,2025-05-22T19:25:31Z,0

If I have 10 portfolios, and one of them performed significantly good over a period of time, while all the others performed moderately bad, my total balance would still be negative. The case mentioned in the video is similar. If Medallion was Simons's only mutual fund, than the story would be more plausable. But that mutual fund was one of his many funds, and besides that it was closed to the public. The good performance of one mutual fund among many can happen by pure chance, but to me it looks like it was some kind of internal scheme and machination with funds deployment, maybe in order to artificially create an appearance of  one successful but exclusive mutual fund, which will attract investors to put their money into his open funds, hoping that it will someday grant them a ticket to enter Medallion.",@RumpeIstiItskin,2025-05-18T20:24:03Z,0

It's based on two assumptions that are not realistic in practice. 1. It assumes everybody has all public information and can process that information in a timely manner. That's clearly not realistic for individual traders, or even most large institutions. 2. It assumes that nobody trades on private information (insider trading) and the price only changes when the information is made public. That is also unrealistic.  So as most people in the industry would say, most traders make money by trading information, public or private. Unless you have a sophisticated quantitively model that exploit some inefficiency in the market (which is also information btw), you need to possess information that others either are not aware of, or dismissed, in order to make money.",@gingerbread_GB,2025-05-18T19:12:25Z,0

And options just being a word with no real value but when written in the contract, it gains some value.   Like say, I am an undergraduate and I have invested some time and money into my degree, ironically my degree gives me some leverage over those who doesn't have one. But if I appear for a job as an experienced (employee) UG student, and also another person with a PG but no work experience, the chances for me to get a job is relatively high (given they are not hiring PG grads). But still person with PG degree has leverage over those with UG with no work experience and those who have no degree. So, that means I as a real person (stock) has a little value, but with work experience (options subscription (calls)) it becomes high. But even if I have PG ( valuable stock) with no work experience (options/futures subscription) I find relatively hard to get a job (increase in stock price) or increase my value. In the end, if I do get a job(Demand because of various reasons by the company) my value as a person (stock) increases definitely, independent of my degree (derivatives), thus after my value increases, my degree do get real meaning and value to it (more volume in derivates trading).
